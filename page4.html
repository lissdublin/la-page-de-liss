<h1>Describe content and layout</h1>
<p>The home page of my website is just the “about me” bit with a quote, 
    an image at the bottom and a button to email me for info or any other queries. 
    On the top you have the navigation bar. I chose the same background image for every page. 
    Then follows page one, two, three and four with the written content. 
    On page one you have a few clickable images that take to to various helpful websites, 
    a link to my Trello board and at the bottom the link to the GDPR website. 
    The following pages are just written content with background image and a navigation bar at the top.</p></div>

<h2>Copyright and constraints</h2>
<p>Copyright affects every webpage. It's about images and videos and even written content can be copyrighted. 
If it belongs to someone else you have to either mention it or in some cases, 
when there's watermarks or some sort 
of background image you'd have to pay to use it on your webpage.

If you used copyrighted material without permission you could face a big fine.</p></div>

<h3>Access issues and how to solve them</h3>
<p>People can have visual restrictions, they might need bigger lettering. 
    Some websites use a magnifying glass as a tool to navigate over the written content. 
Flashy images can cause damage to people with epilepsy so it would be advisable to at least give a warning 
(or you could get sued). Night mode is another handy tool that's favourable to the eyes. </p></div>

<h4>Which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h4>
<p>There's different filetypes and extensions you can use for your website. 
    For pictures you can use .jpg (or j.peg) and .png are the most common ones, 
    there is .mpg (or .mpeg) for movies but also .mp4 and .mov /.qt which stand for QuickTime Movie.
     .gif's are moving images and are the most commonly used on the internet. For musical content you can use 
     .mp3 or .wav's. There's also .txt and .doc's for word / text files and for a group of compressed files 
     you'll find a .zip file. </p></div>
