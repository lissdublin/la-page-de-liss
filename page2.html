<h1>Review of Tools we used</h1>

<p>All the tools we used have been quite helpful. The Trello board is not a must I'd say, but it is very helpful by telling you where you're at if you've set it up properly. Without VS Code, html and CSS (and our Code Nation teacher) the project would not have happened at all. Those are the essentials.</p></div>

<h2>Describe the selected tools</h2>
<p>The Trello board is non essential but a very handy tool to get yourself organised. You can put ideas down, add your comments or add files and have lists of things you want to do or have already done.
    Vs code is needed so you can actually code your website, and html helps you to structure it. It's the bones of a website I'd say. After this you can make it look beautiful with CSS, add colour and fonts, make a nice layout.</p>

<h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Like a lot of people I'd say my enthusiasm overweights, I've got a head full of Ideas, but to make it look the way you want it to is not as easy as you thought. I'm happy I got the basics, but there is still a lot to learn, and to get the hang of it I'll have to stick with it and keep practicing.</p>

<h4>Improvements</h4>
<p>The website I created is still a bit basic. If I had more time I would add a lot more details to it. One thing I wanted to do is like a newsletter you could subscribe to. I also wanted to have a black and white background picture with a different bit in colour on every page and the boxes aligned to that coloured bit. As a trained “classic” artist I would have wanted to have more tools, like maybe an ipad pro to do sketches on and include them in the website, or even on the Trello board.</p>

<h5>Review</h5>
<p>CSS is super easy to use as you can have two windows open while your editing in your CSS and html and in the other window you can have your browser open and just need to click on your refresh button to check if it all works fine and looks the way you'd like it to.</p>
