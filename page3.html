    <h1>Review benefits and drawbacks of IT tools</h1>
    <p>Having practice would certainly improve the efficiency of using any tool. It is always exciting to get into something new, but it also takes time to do research and tests. As a novice this can take a bit longer then for an experienced developer. That's where I think it is important to have teams. If you have and experienced person on the team they can help out when you're stuck. When developing one project as a team there's obviously also other things to consider as there needs to be an agreement on a theme and so on, which can also take time.</p>

    <div>
        <h1>Ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h1>
    <p>This is more or less the same as already mentioned above.
    Practice is important, keep updated of what's going on, stay informed... visit different websites, have the right tools to work with and communication with other people to get different opinions.</p>
</div>

    <div>
        <h1>Develop solutions</h1>
        <p>Again, practice practice practice, and test your projects and get them tested by others. Time restrictions can get in the way as well, just move the deadline a little further away. Read reviews about the different tools that are available and get the ones that are best suited for you and the project you're working on.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>How would you go about testing digital solutions</h1>
    <p> Ask around, family and friends but can also use online platforms for questions and answers, and testing if there's any people interested. </p>
