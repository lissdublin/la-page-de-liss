        Hello,
<br>
<br>
My name is Liss. 
I am a passionate learner. 
I love new challenges and finding out about new things.
Languages are one of these things I love. 
I speak English, French and German but all these are very restricted, 
so when I got the opportunity to learn computer language, I immediately said yes.
It was an intense 3 week course with Code Nation, and this website reflects 
a little what we have learnt in these three weeks... 
<br>
but not all- we've learnt a lot more.

<br>
 <br>   
If you want to know any more, please just drop me an <button> <a href="mailto:dublin.liss@gmail.com">email </a></button> </p>
